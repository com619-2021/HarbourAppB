# Harbour Master Prototype Application
A very early demonstration as to how REST is going to be handled.
Any REST endpoints in this project are subject to change.

To run the program, enter:

`mvn spring-boot:run`

in this directory.

This project uses Swagger. Once running, you can view API details on the Swagger page at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/.

TODO: include instructions regarding docker packaging.
